# Sales-Strategy

## Project Overview
This analysis examines the first six weeks after the product launch, aiming to find the most effective sales strategy and uncover insights into customer behavior. The three different sales strategies are:

1. **Email only method**: Customers here received an email during product launch and 3 weeks after.

2. **Call only method**: Customers here received calls during product launch and 3 weeks after. With each call lasting about 30 minutes per customer.

3. **Email and call method**: Customers here received an email during product launch and a call 3 weeks later with each call lasting about 10 minutes per customer.

### What the business needs to know:
- How many customers were there for each approach?
- What does the spread of the revenue look like overall? And for each method?
- Was there any difference in revenue overtime for each of the methods
- Based on the data, which method would you recommend we continue to use?

**Tool Used:** Power BI 

**Data Cleaning:**
I started by removing duplicate entries. and promoting first rows to headers. Next, I standardized the ‘sales_method’ column, correcting inconsistent entries like “em + call” and “email” to the correct labels: “Email,” “Call,” and “Email + Call.” I also changed the revenue data from a text format to a number format, ensuring that the data was clean and ready for accurate analysis.

### **Key Insights:**
1. **Customer Acquisition and Engagement**
A total of 15,000 customers were targeted across the three strategies, with the following distribution:
- Email-Only: 7,466 customers (49.77%)
- Call-Only: 4,962 customers (33.08%)
- Email and Call: 2,572 customers (17.15%)-

In terms of website engagement, the Email-Only strategy drove the highest traffic:

- Email-Only: 185,000 website visits (49.33%)
- Call-Only: 121,000 website visits (32.27%)
- Email and Call: 79,000 website visits (21.07%)
The data suggests that email outreach is effective in driving customer interest and engagement.

2. **Revenue Trends** <br>
   ***a. By Sales Method:***

- Email-Only: Experienced a slight decline in sales after the third week, possibly due to diminishing interest or market saturation.
- Call-Only: Revenue showed a slight uptick in the fifth week, possibly due to repeated customer engagement.
- Email and Call: Revenue steadily increased over the weeks, with the highest sales observed in the latter part of the period.
<br><br>Interestingly, despite the Call-Only method engaging nearly twice as many customers and driving higher website visits compared to the Email and Call method, the revenue generated by the Email and Call approach was nearly twice as high. This suggests that a balanced combination of email and follow-up calls can be more effective in converting engagement into sales.

  ***b. Over Time***:<br>
- **Week 1**: The Email-Only group generated the highest revenue, driven by the initial product launch and email campaign, which effectively sparked immediate sales.
- **Weeks 2–3**: Revenue from the Email-Only group began to decline, while the Call-Only group maintained steady sales. The Email and Call strategy started showing gradual growth during this period.
- **Week 4**: Revenue increased again, particularly for the Email and Call group, as the follow-up calls were made, reinforcing customer interest.
- **Week 5**: The Call-Only group saw a slight revenue increase, likely due to sustained customer engagement through calls.
- **Week 6**: Revenue dipped slightly overall, but the Email and Call method continued to outperform the others in terms of sustained sales.

3. **Customer Segmentation**:<br>
    Customers were segmented based on their tenure with the brand:
- *New Customers* (0–4 years): 8,920 customers
- *Long-Term Customers* (5–9 years): 3,860 customers
- *Old Customers* (10+ years): 2,220 customers
<br>New customers, especially those in their first year, generated the most sales and revenue, indicating that fresh engagements were more effective in driving purchases.

### Recommendations:<br>
Based on these findings, the following recommendations are proposed:
1. **Focus on Email-Only as the Main Strategy**: Since it’s efficient and reaches a broad audience, the email-only method should remain the primary approach, especially for large campaigns.

2. **Use Email & Call for Key Customers**: Reserve this approach for new or high-potential customers, as combining emails with follow-up calls is highly effective in boosting revenue for these groups.

3. **Limit Call-Only Usage**: Due to its lower efficiency, the call-only method should be used sparingly or as part of a broader strategy where calls support other methods.

By optimizing these strategies, the sales team can maximize revenue while using resources wisely.

### Conclusion:
The analysis compared three sales strategies: Email-Only, Call-Only, and a combination of both. The Email-Only strategy generated initial interest but struggled to maintain long-term engagement and revenue. The Call-Only approach improved engagement but required more time and effort without significantly boosting revenue. The Email and Call combination was the most successful, effectively maintaining customer interest and driving the highest revenue growth over time.
